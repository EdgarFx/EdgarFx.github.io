Loop closure detection is vital in the process of SLAM, as it helps reduce the accumulative drift of the robot’s estimated odometry and generate a globally consistent map. However, in confined-space environments such as narrow pipes, conventional loop closure methods suffer perceptual aliasing due to feature scarcity and textural repetitiveness. In this research, we aim to develop a robust loop closure module in confined-space environments on top of our prior confined-space dense RGB-D SLAM method, visual-laser-inertial (VLI) SLAM. Specifically, we define the concept of word group based on spatial proximity and positions of features and propose to build and maintain a novel loop closure detection module called Bag-of-Word-Groups (BoWG) online, which provides context-specific feature representation. Besides, we utilize Gaussian pyramids to implement Multi-scale Good Features To Track (MS-GFTT) to detect richer features at various scales for word group analysis. Our method does not require any extra sensor other than a monocular visual camera and can be easily integrated into existing Bag-of-Words (BoW) methods. To validate the proposed method, we conduct real-world experiments in a narrow, feature-sparse pipeline with loops. Experiment results show that our method is robust and can achieve high precision while maintaining acceptable recall when the perceptual aliasing problem is serious. In addition, the proposed method has the potential to be applied to environments other than narrow pipes.\n","date":1691107200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691107200,"objectID":"2a1384775b26064a2229fa7789959ffb","permalink":"https://EdgarFx.github.io/research/bowg/","publishdate":"2023-08-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/bowg/","section":"research","summary":"A feature detector capable of detecting features at different scales based on an image pyramid.

Although classical risk estimation methods are extensively utilized, the implicit pre-assumptions about distribution are predominantly contained and challenging to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. A quantum computing-based carbon market risk estimation framework is proposed to address this issue with the quantum conditional generative adversarial networks-quantum amplitude estimation (QCGAN-QAE) algorithm. Specifically, QCGAN is employed to simulate the future distribution of the generated loss rate, whereas QAE is applied to measure the distribution. Also, the quantum circuit of the QCGAN improved by reordering the data entanglement layer and data rotation layer, coupled with the introduction of the quantum fully connected layer. And the binary search method is incorporated into the QAE to bolster the computational efficiency. The simulation results based on the European Union Emissions Trading System manifest that the proposed framework markedly enhances the efficiency and precision of Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) compared to original methods.","tags":[],"title":"Carbon Market Risk Estimation Using Quantum Generative Adversarial Network and Amplitude Estimation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiang Fei","Huan Zhao","Xiyuan Zhou","Junhua Zhao","Ting Shu","Fushuan Wen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1681516800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1681516800,"objectID":"9e9193cff6b4000723ab5356defa91ce","permalink":"https://EdgarFx.github.io/publication/q_optimization/","publishdate":"2023-04-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/q_optimization/","section":"publication","summary":"Power system fault diagnosis is crucial for identifying the location and causes of the fault process and providing fault decision-making basis for the dispatchers. However, classical methods suffer from significant time-consuming, memory overhead, and computational complexity issues as the scale of system increases. With the rapid development of quantum computing technology, the combinatorial optimization solution method based on quantum computing has shown certain advantages in computational time. Therefore, this paper proposes a quantum computing based power system fault diagnosis method with Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). The proposed method uses the Ising model to construct the problem Hamiltonian, which completely preserves the coupling relationship between the faulty components and the various operations of protective relays (PR) and circuit breakers (CB). Additionally, the symmetric equivalent decomposition of the multi-z-rotation gate is proposed to enhance the problem-solving efficiency under current equipment limitations. Furthermore, a method to reduce the number of qubits required by quantum computing is proposed, which utilizes the small probability events characteristic of the power system. The simulation results based on a test system show that proposed methods can achieve the same optimal results and have a faster speed than the classical algorithm.","tags":[],"title":"Power System Fault Diagnosis with Quantum Computing and Efficient Gate Decomposition","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Power system fault diagnosis helps to reproduce the fault process and provide the dispatchers with a basis for fault decision-making.
