Loop closure detection is vital in the process of SLAM, as it helps reduce the accumulative drift of the robot’s estimated odometry and generate a globally consistent map. However, in confined-space environments such as narrow pipes, conventional loop closure methods suffer perceptual aliasing due to feature scarcity and textural repetitiveness. In this research, we aim to develop a robust loop closure module in confined-space environments on top of our prior confined-space dense RGB-D SLAM method, visual-laser-inertial (VLI) SLAM. Specifically, we define the concept of word group based on spatial proximity and positions of features and propose to build and maintain a novel loop closure detection module called Bag-of-Word-Groups (BoWG) online, which provides context-specific feature representation. Besides, we utilize Gaussian pyramids to implement Multi-scale Good Features To Track (MS-GFTT) to detect richer features at various scales for word group analysis. Our method does not require any extra sensor other than a monocular visual camera and can be easily integrated into existing Bag-of-Words (BoW) methods. To validate the proposed method, we conduct real-world experiments in a narrow, feature-sparse pipeline with loops. Experiment results show that our method is robust and can achieve high precision while maintaining acceptable recall when the perceptual aliasing problem is serious. In addition, the proposed method has the potential to be applied to environments other than narrow pipes.\n","date":1691107200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691107200,"objectID":"2a1384775b26064a2229fa7789959ffb","permalink":"https://EdgarFx.github.io/research/bowg/","publishdate":"2023-08-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/bowg/","section":"research","summary":"A feature detector capable of detecting features at different scales based on an image pyramid.

Our work was based on Prof. Bansal’s prior work LB-WayPtNav, which is a learning-based navigation method and can generate some way points to guide the movement of the robot. This method can be used to navigate in novel environments, however, it would generate infeasible paths for some cases such as tight corners and narrow hallways. This is because this method struggles to provide accurate metric reconstruction when necessary (e.g. tight corners, narrow hallways). Meanwhile, visual SLAM algorithms can generate consistent metric maps, but are often computationally expensive to run, and do not provide relevant semantic information. Therefore, we try to establish a pipeline that combines both SLAM and the learning-based method to support an efficient autonomous navigation framework. As a proof of concept, we showed that SLAM with particle filtering pairing algorithm and LiDAR information is able to successfully navigate situations that proved challenging for the purely learning based approach presented by Bansal. After that, we designed a switching mechanism that can switch to SLAM from learning based approach when the current scene is challenging, which is based on reachability analysis.\n","date":1684576800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684576800,"objectID":"c14c9e1587f9e40bafe88c5f4625bc4f","permalink":"https://EdgarFx.github.io/project/navigation/","publishdate":"2023-05-20T10:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/navigation/","section":"project","summary":"Integration of learning-based perception techniques and visual SLAM methods to develop a reliable and efficient autonomous navigation system that can adapt to challenging and unpredictable scenarios with a high success rate.","tags":null,"title":"SLAM for Vision-based Navigation","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Accurate carbon price forecasting is important for investors and policymakers to make decisions in the carbon market.

The main goal of this project was to document the endoscopy process in 3D and to help doctors realize a more comprehensive examination. Given the project’s emphasis on reconstruction accuracy over real-time operation, I opted to explore methods rooted in Structure from Motion (SfM) instead of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). During the reconstruction process within a structure like the human gastrointestinal tract and sinus surface, various challenges arose, such as textureless image frames, varying lighting conditions, and contaminated frames. To address these issues, I employed learning-based approaches. Utilizing the sparse reconstruction and camera pose obtained by SfM with SIFT as self-supervised signals, I trained a two-branch Siamese network to achieve dense depth estimation and feature descriptors. Following this, depth fusion and surface extraction were performed to reconstruct a highly accurate watertight triangle mesh surface of the gastrointestinal tract and sinus surface. There, I was responsible for methodology conceptualization and code implementation.\nFigure 1. Point cloud obtained by the dense depth estimation.\rFigure 2. The overlay of the video and the point cloud obtain by COLMAP with the dense feature descriptors.\rMore Details about Learning-based Dense Depth Estimation and Feature Descriptors 1. Dense Depth Estimation The figure depicts the architecture of a dense depth estimation network. In general, the network training relies on a loss function to update network parameters by backpropagating useful information in the form of gradients. The loss function comprises the introduced components: Sparse Flow Loss and Depth Consistency Loss. To guide the training of depth estimation using these losses, several types of input data are necessary. These inputs include endoscopic video frames, camera poses and intrinsic parameters, sparse depth maps, sparse soft masks, and sparse flow maps, elaborated in the training data section. Finally, in order to transform the network predictions obtained from Monocular Depth Estimation into an appropriate format for loss computation, several custom layers are employed. These custom layers include the Depth Scaling Layer, Depth Warping Layer, and Flow from Depth Layer, detailed in the network architecture section.\n1.1 Training Data The training data originates from unlabeled endoscopic videos, as illustrated in the framework above.\nData Preprocessing: Initially, the video sequences undergo undistortion using distortion coefficients estimated from the respective calibrated videos. Sparse reconstruction, camera poses, and point visibility are estimated by Structure from Motion (SfM) from the undistorted video sequences, excluding black invalid regions within video frames. Point cloud filtering is employed to remove extreme outliers from the sparse reconstruction. To smooth the point visibility information by leveraging continuous camera movement in the video, as depicted in Figure b, is utilized. The sparse form data generated from SfM results is elaborated below. Sparse Depth Maps: Monocular Depth Estimation solely predicts depth on a global scale. However, for effective loss computation, the scale of depth prediction must align with the SfM results. Hence, the introduced sparse depth maps here serve as anchors for scaling depth predictions in the Depth Scaling Layer. To generate sparse depth maps, 3D points from sparse reconstruction by SfM are projected onto the image plane with camera poses, intrinsic functions, and point visibility information. Sparse Flow Maps: Sparse flow maps are utilized for the subsequent Sparse Flow Loss (SFL). Previously, we directly used sparse depth maps for loss computation to leverage self-supervised signals from sparse reconstruction. This led to fixed and potentially biased training targets, such as sparse depth maps, per frame. In contrast to sparse depth maps, sparse flow maps describe 2D projection motion of sparse reconstruction involving camera poses of two input frames with random frame intervals. By combining camera trajectories and sparse reconstruction and considering all pairs of frame combinations, errors in new targets, like sparse flow maps, are likely unbiased per frame. This reduces the influence of random noise in training data on the network. For models trained using SFL, depth predictions exhibit natural smoothness and edge preservation, eliminating the need for explicit regularization during training. Sparse Soft Masks：Sparse masks enable the network to utilize effective sparse signals within sparse form data while disregarding other invalid areas. Soft weighting defined before training interprets the fact that the error distribution of individual points in SfM results varies and mitigates the impact of SfM reconstruction errors.

China-based Stock Exchanges have no mandatory disclosure requirements for carbon emission information of listed companies either. In the absence of uniform standards, there may be inconsistencies in the statistical methodologies of corporate carbon information disclosure, resulting in the lack of comparability among different emission data. Domestic regulatory authorities need to establish a unified corporate carbon information disclosure standard to supervise the carbon information disclosure of listed companies and assist companies, thus to carry out standardized disclosure. Carbon disclosure is now of great practical significance to the development of enterprises. The leading enterprises in the capital market generally have higher disclosure levels, which will be in turn incentivized by the stock market, thus forming a positive cycle. At the same time, with the national carbon peaking and carbon neutrality policy in place, carbon disclosure, as a social and environmental factor, will continuously be the focus of the capital market. It will also have a greater impact on a company’s stock price, profits and other financial performances. Therefore, it is even more imperative for all companies to improve their own carbon emission management and disclosure systems.
