However, conventional methods struggle in perceptually aliased environments, such as narrow pipes, due to vector quantization, feature sparsity, and repetitive textures, while existing solutions often incur high computational costs. This paper presents Bag-of-Word-Groups (BoWG), a novel loop closure detection method that achieves superior precision-recall, robustness, and computational efficiency. The core innovation lies in the introduction of word groups, which captures the spatial co-occurrence and proximity of visual words to construct an online dictionary. Additionally, drawing inspiration from probabilistic transition models, we incorporate temporal consistency directly into similarity computation with an adaptive scheme, substantially improving precision-recall performance. The method is further strengthened by a feature distribution analysis module and dedicated post-verification mechanisms. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on both public datasets and a confined-pipe dataset we constructed. Results demonstrate that BoWG surpasses state-of-the-art methods—including both traditional and learning-based approaches—in terms of precision-recall and computational efficiency. Our approach also exhibits excellent scalability, achieving an average processing time of 16 ms per image across 17,565 images in the Bicocca25b dataset.

The main goal of this project was to document the endoscopy process in 3D and to help doctors realize a more comprehensive examination. Given the project’s emphasis on reconstruction accuracy over real-time operation, I opted to explore methods rooted in Structure from Motion (SfM) instead of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). During the reconstruction process within a structure like the human gastrointestinal tract and sinus surface, various challenges arose, such as textureless image frames, varying lighting conditions, and contaminated frames. To address these issues, I employed learning-based approaches. Utilizing the sparse reconstruction and camera pose obtained by SfM with SIFT as self-supervised signals, I trained a two-branch Siamese network to achieve dense depth estimation and feature descriptors. Following this, depth fusion and surface extraction were performed to reconstruct a highly accurate watertight triangle mesh surface of the gastrointestinal tract and sinus surface. There, I was responsible for methodology conceptualization and code implementation.\nFigure 1. Point cloud obtained by the dense depth estimation. Figure 2. The overlay of the video and the point cloud obtain by COLMAP with the dense feature descriptors. More Details about Learning-based Dense Depth Estimation and Feature Descriptors 1. Dense Depth Estimation The figure depicts the architecture of a dense depth estimation network. In general, the network training relies on a loss function to update network parameters by backpropagating useful information in the form of gradients. The loss function comprises the introduced components: Sparse Flow Loss and Depth Consistency Loss. To guide the training of depth estimation using these losses, several types of input data are necessary. These inputs include endoscopic video frames, camera poses and intrinsic parameters, sparse depth maps, sparse soft masks, and sparse flow maps, elaborated in the training data section. Finally, in order to transform the network predictions obtained from Monocular Depth Estimation into an appropriate format for loss computation, several custom layers are employed. These custom layers include the Depth Scaling Layer, Depth Warping Layer, and Flow from Depth Layer, detailed in the network architecture section.\n1.1 Training Data The training data originates from unlabeled endoscopic videos, as illustrated in the framework above.\nData Preprocessing: Initially, the video sequences undergo undistortion using distortion coefficients estimated from the respective calibrated videos. Sparse reconstruction, camera poses, and point visibility are estimated by Structure from Motion (SfM) from the undistorted video sequences, excluding black invalid regions within video frames. Point cloud filtering is employed to remove extreme outliers from the sparse reconstruction. To smooth the point visibility information by leveraging continuous camera movement in the video, as depicted in Figure b, is utilized. The sparse form data generated from SfM results is elaborated below. Sparse Depth Maps: Monocular Depth Estimation solely predicts depth on a global scale. However, for effective loss computation, the scale of depth prediction must align with the SfM results. Hence, the introduced sparse depth maps here serve as anchors for scaling depth predictions in the Depth Scaling Layer. To generate sparse depth maps, 3D points from sparse reconstruction by SfM are projected onto the image plane with camera poses, intrinsic functions, and point visibility information. Sparse Flow Maps: Sparse flow maps are utilized for the subsequent Sparse Flow Loss (SFL). Previously, we directly used sparse depth maps for loss computation to leverage self-supervised signals from sparse reconstruction. This led to fixed and potentially biased training targets, such as sparse depth maps, per frame. In contrast to sparse depth maps, sparse flow maps describe 2D projection motion of sparse reconstruction involving camera poses of two input frames with random frame intervals. By combining camera trajectories and sparse reconstruction and considering all pairs of frame combinations, errors in new targets, like sparse flow maps, are likely unbiased per frame. This reduces the influence of random noise in training data on the network. For models trained using SFL, depth predictions exhibit natural smoothness and edge preservation, eliminating the need for explicit regularization during training. Sparse Soft Masks：Sparse masks enable the network to utilize effective sparse signals within sparse form data while disregarding other invalid areas. Soft weighting defined before training interprets the fact that the error distribution of individual points in SfM results varies and mitigates the impact of SfM reconstruction errors.

China-based Stock Exchanges have no mandatory disclosure requirements for carbon emission information of listed companies either.

Domestic regulatory authorities need to establish a unified corporate carbon information disclosure standard to supervise the carbon information disclosure of listed companies and assist companies, thus to carry out standardized disclosure. Carbon disclosure is now of great practical significance to the development of enterprises. The leading enterprises in the capital market generally have higher disclosure levels, which will be in turn incentivized by the stock market, thus forming a positive cycle. At the same time, with the national carbon peaking and carbon neutrality policy in place, carbon disclosure, as a social and environmental factor, will continuously be the focus of the capital market. It will also have a greater impact on a company’s stock price, profits and other financial performances.
