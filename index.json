The main aim of the research is to create a new autonomous navigation pipeline that incorporates learning-based perception for extracting distinctive features and semantic interpretation, and model-based SLAM for inference and metric map reconstruction. Specifically, learning-based perception techniques have the ability to successfully identify objects that are important for the subsequent navigation task, but may face difficulties in accurately reconstructing metrics in challenging scenarios such as narrow hallways and tight corners. On the other hand, visual SLAM methods can produce consistent metric maps but often require significant computational resources, and do not provide relevant semantic information.

A comprehensive dataset is constructed, encompassing ﬁrm-level carbon allowance data and ﬁrm-level emission data from July 2021 to December 2022. Our ﬁndings indicate that, in the initial years of China’s ETS implementation, companies participating in the national ETS experienced a statistically signiﬁcant superior performance compared to non-participating ﬁrms due to excess free carbon emission allowances. Results also show that National ETS resulted in a statistically signiﬁcant reduction in emissions of regulated companies. Nevertheless, involvement in the regional ETS yielded no discernible e↵ect on the ﬁnancial and environmental performance of regulated entities. The outcomes reveal the existence of a substantial and statistically signiﬁcant ”over-allocation of carbon allowances,” predominantly attributable to increased non-operational income of regulated companies in China’s national ETS.\n","date":1681344000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1681344000,"objectID":"0d940111fce4ba1bcf7001ea39332313","permalink":"https://EdgarFx.github.io/research/ets/","publishdate":"2023-04-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/ets/","section":"research","summary":"This paper conducts an empirical analysis of the impact of China’s national and regional Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) on the ﬁnancial performance of listed companies.","tags":["Carbon Market"],"title":"Carbon Disclosure Effect, Corporate Fundamentals, and Net-zero Emission Target: Evidence from China","type":"research"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This paper studied carbon market clearing, electricity market clearing, and computable general equilibrium (CGE) models to simulate carbon, electricity, and macro-economy systems.

China-based Stock Exchanges have no mandatory disclosure requirements for carbon emission information of listed companies either. In the absence of uniform standards, there may be inconsistencies in the statistical methodologies of corporate carbon information disclosure, resulting in the lack of comparability among different emission data. Domestic regulatory authorities need to establish a unified corporate carbon information disclosure standard to supervise the carbon information disclosure of listed companies and assist companies, thus to carry out standardized disclosure. Carbon disclosure is now of great practical significance to the development of enterprises. The leading enterprises in the capital market generally have higher disclosure levels, which will be in turn incentivized by the stock market, thus forming a positive cycle. At the same time, with the national carbon peaking and carbon neutrality policy in place, carbon disclosure, as a social and environmental factor, will continuously be the focus of the capital market. It will also have a greater impact on a company’s stock price, profits and other financial performances. Therefore, it is even more imperative for all companies to improve their own carbon emission management and disclosure systems. While achieving emission reduction targets, they should also reduce the carbon emission intensity and improve the quality of carbon information disclosure.
