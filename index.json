Traditional approaches often struggle in challenging environments - such as severe illumination changes, dynamic objects, occlusions, and fast motions - due to their reliance on geometric visual features. Our method leverages learning-based feature matching and metrics-aware covariance to robustly estimate visual poses. Moreover, we explicitly compute the covariance of these visual poses to enable more effective joint VI optimization. A learning-based IMU model, AirIMU, can further be incorporated to provide precise IMU corrections and reliable uncertainty estimates for IMU pre-integration. Experiments in challenging scenarios demonstrate that our approach substantially improves the robustness and accuracy compared with existing methods.\nVideo Demos These videos illustrate the gravity-direction initialization results (Orange: estimated gravity; Green: ground truth) across different environments. Subsequent localization and mapping are carried out by jointly optimizing the visual pose graph (PGO) together with either standard IMU residuals or those from AirIMU. When AirIMU is used, the localization and mapping system effectively becomes MACVIO, a learning-based stereo visual-inertial odometry that we are also developing.\nLunar Environment (TartanairV2 Dataset) Your browser does not support the video tag.

This technique enables in-pipe 3D reconstruction and defect detection.\nIn-pipe VLI-SLAM for Pipe Inspection VLI-SLAM The above in-pipe 3D reconstruction is adapted from VLI-SLAM, a prior work of our lab. VLI-SLAM incorporates the laser-based structured light technique into a traditional monocular visual-inertial SLAM system.\nThe following figures illustrate the hardware prototype for deploying VLI-SLAM, the ray-casting problem for solving the depth of laser point, and the software framework of VLI-SLAM.\nHardware Prototype of the Original Compact Scanner\nRay-casting Problem of the Laser-based Structured Light\nSoftware framework and data flow visualization of VLI-SLAM Extend VLI-SLAM to In-pipe Environments To extend VLI-SLAM to in-pipe environments, the main problem is to consider the prototype design, especially how to achieve the laser-based structured light system. A straight-forward way is to project laser beam onto a conic mirror to generate laser-ring, as the following figures show.\nHardware Prototype of the In-pipe Robot with Laser Pole\nRay-casting Problem of the Laser-based Structured Light with Laser Ring\nUnreal Engine Simulation The figures (a), (b) are from the real pipe; (c), (d) are from the simulated environment.\nAnother Design Exploration This above laser pole-based design is our current and most mature model. However, this design requires a dedicated laser pole to generate the laser ring, which restricts the robot’s mobility in confined pipes, particularly during turns. So we also explored other solutions, for example, generate a conical laser emission using diffractive optical elements. The first question is how to calibrate the conical laser surface. The following is our proposed laser cone calibration method, which achieves sub-millimeter accuracy even though the detected laser points are sparse and unevenly distributed.\nCalibration Software Procedure:\nStep 1: An image review window will pop up for collecting images (Press “s” to save image or “q” to exit).\nIn this step, we need to pay attention that the laser points near the checkerboard corners will interfere the detection of the checkerboard corners, as shown in the figure below, so we need to avoid the collision. Currently I just physically masked some parts of the laser.\nFigure: Collision of laser points and checkerboard corners\nStep 2: Another window will pop up to examine the Laser detection result. (Press ‘y’ to accept, ’n’ to reject current image).\nFigure: An example visualization in step 2\nIn this step, the 0-Order laser point and laser rings in each image are detected, and the user can see the result in a window. If the detection for some images is not so good, the user can reject these images. The figure above is an example visualization in step 2. The white point is the 0-Order laser point, and the blue points are those belong to laser rings.\nStep 3: Laser cones will be fitted and visualized, results will be saved in config files.\nFigure: Pipeline of laser cones fitting\nLaser Cone Fitting\nIn this step, the laser cones will be fitted with the accepted images. The pipeline for laser cones fitting is shown in the figure above.\nWe firstly use the detected 0-Order laser points to fit the cone axis equation in camera frame with RANSAC, the equation is represented in parametric form:\n$$x = x_0 + v_x s$$\n$$y = y_0 + v_y s$$\n$$z = z_0 + v_z s$$\nThen, we can try to fit the cone in the laser frame (origin is the cone vertex). This is because in laser frame, the cone can be described by the standard cone equation, so the shape can be constrained:\n$$\\frac{x_l^2 + y_l^2}{a^2} - \\frac{z_l^2}{b^2} = 0$$\nLet $R^{cl}$ and $t^{cl}$ represent the rotation and translation from camera frame to laser frame, we have:\n$$X_l = R^{cl}X_c + t^{cl}$$\nwhere $X_l = [x_l, y_l, z_l]^T$ is the coordinates in laser frame, and $X_c = [x_c, y_c, z_c]^T$ is the coordinates in camera frame.\nFor $R^{cl}$, it can be simply computed after we get the equation of the cone axis. But currently we don’t know $t_{cl}$ since we don’t know the position of the cone vertex. Therefore, to fit the cone, we need to modify the equation (4), let $r_l^2 = x_l^2 + y_l^2$, and $b = 1$, the equation becomes:\n$$r_l^2 = a^2 z_l^2$$\nHere $r_l$ is actually the distance from the laser point to the cone axis, so it can be computed in the camera frame without knowing the camera-laser transformation. In addition, since $r_l, a, z_l \u0026gt; 0$, we can simplify the equation as:\n$$r_l = a z_l$$\nThen, according to the previous equation, we have:\n$$z_l = R^{cl}_3 X_c + t^{cl}_3$$\nwhere $R^{cl}_3$ is the third row of $R^{cl}$, and $t^{cl}_3$ is the third row of $t^{cl}$.\nLet $z_l’ = R^{cl}_3 X_c$, $k = a \\cdot t^{cl}_3$, and substitute into the equation, we have:\n$$r_l = az_l’ + k$$\nIn this equation, $z_l’$ is only determined by the coordinates of laser …","date":1730419200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1730419200,"objectID":"860761cba5bc6b2121a53a659d4b629c","permalink":"https://EdgarFx.github.io/project/vli_slam/","publishdate":"2024-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/vli_slam/","section":"project","summary":"This work extended a compact, low-cast visual-laser-inertial SLAM-based 3D scanner to narrow pipe environments.","tags":null,"title":"Visual-Laser-Inertial SLAM for 3D Reconstruction of Confined Pipes","type":"project"},{"authors":["Xiyuan Zhou","Huan Zhao","Yuji Cao","Xiang Fei","Gaoqi Liang","Junhua Zhao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1723075200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1723075200,"objectID":"9ba42d9ee9dbe5bfd60f5b46f3b2b2c4","permalink":"https://EdgarFx.github.io/publication/q_gan/","publishdate":"2024-08-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/q_gan/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":[],"title":"Carbon Market Risk Estimation Using Quantum Conditional Generative Adversarial Network and Amplitude Estimation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiang Fei","Huan Zhao","Xiyuan Zhou","Junhua Zhao","Ting Shu","Fushuan Wen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1721693520,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721693520,"objectID":"9e9193cff6b4000723ab5356defa91ce","permalink":"https://EdgarFx.github.io/publication/q_optimization/","publishdate":"2024-07-23T00:12:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/q_optimization/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":[],"title":"Power System Fault Diagnosis with Quantum Computing and Efficient Gate Decomposition","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this research project, we propose real-ACMM, which is a photorealistic 3D reconstruction method with MVS.

The main goal of this project was to document the endoscopy process in 3D and to help doctors realize a more comprehensive examination. Given the project’s emphasis on reconstruction accuracy over real-time operation, I opted to explore methods rooted in Structure from Motion (SfM) instead of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). During the reconstruction process within a structure like the human gastrointestinal tract and sinus surface, various challenges arose, such as textureless image frames, varying lighting conditions, and contaminated frames. To address these issues, I employed learning-based approaches. Utilizing the sparse reconstruction and camera pose obtained by SfM with SIFT as self-supervised signals, I trained a two-branch Siamese network to achieve dense depth estimation and feature descriptors. Following this, depth fusion and surface extraction were performed to reconstruct a highly accurate watertight triangle mesh surface of the gastrointestinal tract and sinus surface. There, I was responsible for methodology conceptualization and code implementation.\nFigure 1. Point cloud obtained by the dense depth estimation. Figure 2. The overlay of the video and the point cloud obtain by COLMAP with the dense feature descriptors. More Details about Learning-based Dense Depth Estimation and Feature Descriptors 1. Dense Depth Estimation The figure depicts the architecture of a dense depth estimation network. In general, the network training relies on a loss function to update network parameters by backpropagating useful information in the form of gradients. The loss function comprises the introduced components: Sparse Flow Loss and Depth Consistency Loss. To guide the training of depth estimation using these losses, several types of input data are necessary. These inputs include endoscopic video frames, camera poses and intrinsic parameters, sparse depth maps, sparse soft masks, and sparse flow maps, elaborated in the training data section. Finally, in order to transform the network predictions obtained from Monocular Depth Estimation into an appropriate format for loss computation, several custom layers are employed. These custom layers include the Depth Scaling Layer, Depth Warping Layer, and Flow from Depth Layer, detailed in the network architecture section.\n1.1 Training Data The training data originates from unlabeled endoscopic videos, as illustrated in the framework above.\nData Preprocessing: Initially, the video sequences undergo undistortion using distortion coefficients estimated from the respective calibrated videos. Sparse reconstruction, camera poses, and point visibility are estimated by Structure from Motion (SfM) from the undistorted video sequences, excluding black invalid regions within video frames. Point cloud filtering is employed to remove extreme outliers from the sparse reconstruction. To smooth the point visibility information by leveraging continuous camera movement in the video, as depicted in Figure b, is utilized. The sparse form data generated from SfM results is elaborated below. Sparse Depth Maps: Monocular Depth Estimation solely predicts depth on a global scale. However, for effective loss computation, the scale of depth prediction must align with the SfM results. Hence, the introduced sparse depth maps here serve as anchors for scaling depth predictions in the Depth Scaling Layer. To generate sparse depth maps, 3D points from sparse reconstruction by SfM are projected onto the image plane with camera poses, intrinsic functions, and point visibility information. Sparse Flow Maps: Sparse flow maps are utilized for the subsequent Sparse Flow Loss (SFL). Previously, we directly used sparse depth maps for loss computation to leverage self-supervised signals from sparse reconstruction. This led to fixed and potentially biased training targets, such as sparse depth maps, per frame. In contrast to sparse depth maps, sparse flow maps describe 2D projection motion of sparse reconstruction involving camera poses of two input frames with random frame intervals. By combining camera trajectories and sparse reconstruction and considering all pairs of frame combinations, errors in new targets, like sparse flow maps, are likely unbiased per frame. This reduces the influence of random noise in training data on the network. For models trained using SFL, depth predictions exhibit natural smoothness and edge preservation, eliminating the need for explicit regularization during training. Sparse Soft Masks：Sparse masks enable the network to utilize effective sparse signals within sparse form data while disregarding other invalid areas.

China-based Stock Exchanges have no mandatory disclosure requirements for carbon emission information of listed companies either. In the absence of uniform standards, there may be inconsistencies in the statistical methodologies of corporate carbon information disclosure, resulting in the lack of comparability among different emission data. Domestic regulatory authorities need to establish a unified corporate carbon information disclosure standard to supervise the carbon information disclosure of listed companies and assist companies, thus to carry out standardized disclosure. Carbon disclosure is now of great practical significance to the development of enterprises. The leading enterprises in the capital market generally have higher disclosure levels, which will be in turn incentivized by the stock market, thus forming a positive cycle. At the same time, with the national carbon peaking and carbon neutrality policy in place, carbon disclosure, as a social and environmental factor, will continuously be the focus of the capital market. It will also have a greater impact on a company’s stock price, profits and other financial performances. Therefore, it is even more imperative for all companies to improve their own carbon emission management and disclosure systems. While achieving emission reduction targets, they should also reduce the carbon emission intensity and improve the quality of carbon information disclosure. This report proposes a carbon rating system and releases the carbon rating of China’s 100 Overseas Listed Companies.\n","date":1655424000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655424000,"objectID":"b0548a039dadde4482350be30061e24c","permalink":"https://EdgarFx.github.io/research/carbon_rating/","publishdate":"2022-06-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/carbon_rating/","section":"research","summary":"2022 Carbon Rating Report of China's 100 Overseas Listed Companies which has been released at the 2022 Global Forum on Sustainable Development.","tags":["Carbon Market"],"title":"2022 Carbon Rating Report of China's 100 Overseas Listed Companies","type":"research"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" [Jun 2025] Our paper Bag of Word Groups (BoWG): A Robust and Efficient Loop Closure Detection Method Under Perceptual Aliasing has been accepted by IROS 2025 🥳.\n[Aug 2024] Our paper Carbon market risk estimation using quantum conditional generative adversarial network and amplitude estimation is published by Energy Conversion and Economics.\n[Jul 2024] Our paper Power system fault diagnosis with quantum computing and efficient gate decomposition is published by Scientific Report (JCR Q1).\n[May 2024] Undergraduate Graduation 🎉!
