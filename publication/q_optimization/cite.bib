      abstract={Power system fault diagnosis is crucial for identifying the location and causes of faults and providing decision-making support for power dispatchers. However, most classical methods suffer from significant time-consuming, memory overhead, and computational complexity issues as the scale of the power system concerned increases. With rapid development of quantum computing technology, the combinatorial optimization method based on quantum computing has shown certain advantages in computational time over existing methods. Given this background, this paper proposes a quantum computing based power system fault diagnosis method with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm. The proposed method reformulates the fault diagnosis problem as a Hamiltonian by using Ising model, which completely preserves the coupling relationship between faulty components and various operations of protective relays and circuit breakers. Additionally, to enhance problem-solving efficiency under current equipment limitations, the symmetric equivalent decomposition method of multi-z-rotation gate is utilized. Furthermore, the small probability characteristics of power system events is utilized to reduce the number of qubits. Simulation results based on the test system show that the proposed methods can achieve the same optimal results with a faster speed compared with the classical higher-order solver provided by D-Wave.},
